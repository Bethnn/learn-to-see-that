today i go to meet the teacher chenlili who says that her has the ispirasion of recording.
i find something , not only she talk about the skills to making a documentories, but the most important is.
her mention the sora , thats the big differences between the natural world and ai technique. 
she says that the most important thing in the world is your creation and the truth thing. and all of the thing is time.use right of the time , and then put them into the thing you really want to do. time is like money what u really put them into something and then they become something else to hepl you a lot!
glad to have a great trip to view some last thing about the old students who has made the vedios already. i just find a big difference in the two subjects here. and i want to chase them.
